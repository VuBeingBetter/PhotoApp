# PhotoApp
An attempt to recreate the CS142 Photo Sharing App. The app is a mocking of social media apps (eg. Threads, X, Instagram, etc.), though with poor UI design and backend features.

An user can upload a status with a photo and others can view it and leave a comment. 

The login route in the current stage of the project is still a mocking login with no authentication process. New users can be registered and can be stored in the database

Tech used: MERN stack
- Database: MongoDB
- Back-end: Node.js, Express.js
- Front-end: React.js
